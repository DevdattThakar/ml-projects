🌟 Machine Learning Projects

A collection of complete, beginner-friendly and industry-ready Machine Learning projects built using Python, Google Colab, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Pandas.
This repository showcases two ML internship tasks:

✔ Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST — CNN)
✔ Movie Recommendation System (Content-Based)

Both projects include explanations, preprocessing, model training, visualizations, and evaluation.

📌 Projects Included
🧠 1. Handwritten Digit Recognizer (MNIST – CNN)

A deep learning model trained on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits (0–9).
Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for high accuracy.

🔍 Features

60,000 training images & 10,000 test images

CNN architecture: Conv → MaxPool → Dense → Softmax

98–99% accuracy

Confusion matrix & loss/accuracy graphs

Predict any custom digit

▶ Open Notebook

🎬 2. Movie Recommendation System (Content-Based)

A machine learning system that recommends similar movies using metadata such as genre, description, and keywords.

🔍 Features

Uses TF-IDF Vectorizer

Cosine Similarity to find similar movies

Lightweight and fast

Works with any movie input

Easily extensible to collaborative filtering

▶ Open Notebook

📚 Combined Portfolio Notebook

A single notebook that includes both project summaries:
✔ Code
✔ Explanations
✔ Results
✔ Visualizations

Perfect for internship submission & LinkedIn.

▶ Open in Colab
